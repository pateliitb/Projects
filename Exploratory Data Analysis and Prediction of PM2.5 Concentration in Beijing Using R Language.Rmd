# 1.Goal of the project

Throughout this project, I will be doing an Exploratory Data Analysis of the PM2.5 Dataset of Bejing, China.


# 2.Loading the Main packeges

I will mainly be using the following packages:

```{r}
library(dplyr) #To work with datasets
library(moments) #To calculate various values of descriptive sattistics 
```

# 3.Importing And Cleaning Dataset

First, I need to import My dataset. The dataset I will be using can be found online at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data#

It was built from public data made available by Song Xi Chen, csx '@' gsm.pku.edu.cn, Guanghua School of Management, Center for Statistical Science, Peking University and
This hourly data set contains the PM2.5 data of US Embassy in Beijing. Meanwhile, meteorological data from Beijing Capital International Airport are also included,for each hour between Jan 1st, 2010 to Dec 31st, 2014. It contains 43824 observations.

```{r}
#loading the dataset file
library(readr)
PM2.5_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/gauta/Downloads/PRSA_data_2010.1.1-2014.12.31-1.csv", header=T)
head(PM2.5_data)
#View(PM2.5_data)
```

### Description of the dataset

    No   : row number
    year : year of data in this row
    month: month of data in this row
    day  : day of data in this row
    hour : hour of data in this row
    PM2.5: PM2.5 concentration (ug/m^3)
    TEMP : temperature (degree Celsius)
    PRES : pressure (hPa)
    DEWP : dew point temperature (degree Celsius)
    Cbwd : Represents the Combined wind direction 
    Iws  : Represents the Cumulated wind speed in (m/s)
    Is   : Represents the Cumulated hours of snow
    Ir	 : Represents the Cumulated hours of rain

###  Duplicate and missing Values: 

```{r}
anyDuplicated(PM2.5_data)


sum(is.na(PM2.5_data))
# Now since our dataset contains the NA values and in small percentage with respect to the whole data(<5%) , therefore we have to remove those NA values instead of impute that NA values as follows:
PM2.5_data <- na.omit(PM2.5_data)
head(PM2.5_data)
##Creating the date column

PM2.5_data$date<-as.Date(with(PM2.5_data,paste(PM2.5_data$year,PM2.5_data$month,PM2.5_data$day,sep="-")),"%Y-%m-%d")

##
##adding the season column
season <- vector('character', nrow(PM2.5_data))
season[PM2.5_data$month == 3 | PM2.5_data$month == 4 | PM2.5_data$month == 5] <- 'spring'
season[PM2.5_data$month == 6 | PM2.5_data$month == 7 | PM2.5_data$month == 8] <- 'summer'
season[PM2.5_data$month == 9 | PM2.5_data$month == 10 | PM2.5_data$month == 11] <- 'fall'
season[PM2.5_data$month == 12 | PM2.5_data$month == 1 | PM2.5_data$month == 2] <- 'winter'
PM2.5_data <- cbind(PM2.5_data, season)
```


# 4.Exploring The Dataset


Before we start fitting a machine learning model on the data, we need to know much about the data by performing an Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insight from it. EDA is simply describing the data by means of visualization. It involves asking questions about the data and answering them with the help of charts/graphs (graphical representation of the data). In this process, we will try to study the behavoir of the amount of pollutant (PM2.5 concentration) in the air and the relationship between other features. Below are some of the questions we will try to answer by analyzing the data, to know more about our dependent and independent variables:

    .what pattern does the amount of PM2.5 concentration in the air recorded in an hour follow for a daily time        period ?
    .In which month does the amount of PM2.5 contained in the air rises ?
    .At what time of the day do we expect the amount of PM2.5 concentration in the air to be high ?
    .In which direction does polluted air/wind mostly move ?
    .How do the other environmental factors affect the amount of PM2.5 concentration in the air ?

We now have our questions so let's just dive into our data and start finding and interpreting some results. But since we are going to take averages of the dependent variable, we should know the distribtution of the data before we do take averages.
So lets start with the summary of the whole dataset as follows:

## 4.1 Summary Of the dataset PM2.5
```{r}
summary(PM2.5_data)
```
## 4.2 Plotting the histogram-plot of the continious variables

### 4.2.1.For Column 6(PM2.5)

boxplot(log(1+PM2.5_data$pm2.5),col = "yellow",main="Box-plot the log(1+PM2.5)",ylab="log(1+pm2.5)")
#From the bar-plot of PM2.5 variable it can concluded that the distribution of PM2.5 is positively skewed, with a skewness of:
skewness(PM2.5_data$pm2.5)
# Also from the box-plot it is clear that we ha too many out-liers, therefore i have transformed the variable PM2.5 to log(1+PM2.5) to reduce the number of outlier and from the box-plot of log(1+PM2.5) it can be seen that transformed PM2.5 variable has very less number of out-liers.
